Plotting iU,
This project demonstrates the use of iU calculating language, as a simple tool for a plotting application.
Plotting iU require SFML library (http://sfml-dev.org) to be installed, and configured.

The application draws the curve of a given function, the user can choose the middle point of view, and the scale.

The project still in its early development stage, lots of bugs to be fixed and more improvements are coming!
